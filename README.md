# The Cost of Living in Portugal: Housing Prices and Household Income

## Introduction:
This project compares the rise in housing prices (for both rent and sale) across Portuguese districts with wage growth from 2015 to 2024, while also providing an insight into the evolution of the number of tourist accommodations.

## Key Insights:
* Across almost all districts, property sale prices have grown dramatically, with many districts doubling or even tripling in value.
* Rent has increased just as fast, in some districts faster than sales prices.
* Average gross wages grew much more slowly across the same period.
* Almost a quarter of the population relies on minimum wage.
* Districts with declining or stagnant populations still experience price increases, indicating that housing inflation is not driven by local demand, but rather by external forces such as tourism, foreign buyers, and short-term rentals.
* Despite efforts to control their growth, the number of tourist accommodations continues to rise alarmingly.
* The housing market is moving faster than the average Portuguese family can adapt.

## Proposed Solutions:
* Increase affordable housing supply.
* Regulate short-term rentals.
* Incentivise housing in low-populated districts.
* Support first-time buyers.
* Increase wage growth to match living costs.

## Conclusion:
The data clearly shows a widening gap between income and housing costs in Portugal, highlighting a growing affordability crisis.

## Edits:
18/12/2025 - I added data related to the Number of Tourist Accommodations and updated the Tableau with the evolution of that number over the years. I also created a new dashboard in Tableau that allows users to compare the selected metric between two districts over time.
